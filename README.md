# University-Personnel-Management
This project involves creating a university personnel management program that stores information for staff, students, and faculty members. Each object type has specific attributes, such as GPA for students and department for faculty. The program must include getters and setters for each data member and at least two constructors for each class. The main objective is to demonstrate the use of inheritance, abstract classes, abstract methods, and method overriding. Additionally, the Student class should calculate tuition invoices, factoring in the cost per credit hour and administrative fees, with a 25% discount for students with a GPA of 3.0 or higher.
